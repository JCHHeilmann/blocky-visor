# DNS server for resolving client IPs to hostnames (PTR lookups).
# Set this to your router/DHCP server to avoid queries going through Blocky.
# Example: "192.168.178.1" (Fritz!Box), "192.168.1.1" (typical router)
# If omitted, uses the system default resolver.
# dns_resolver: "192.168.178.1"

# Blocky installation directory. Defaults to /opt/blocky.
# config_path and log_dir are derived from this unless overridden.

  # only works on Linux with systemd;
